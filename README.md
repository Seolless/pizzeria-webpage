This is my Odin Project restaurant assignment. (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) 
I would consider the project finished but not polished (I skipped making it compatible with phone screen sizes). 
The reason is mainly that id rather start with the next project to get better at what i think is most importand right now, Javascript. 
(Also they havent started with reactive design yet in the curriculum) so i feel like its justified.

Thoughts and Challenges.

I found the project quite fun (except the css), but who likes css anyways!?
I didnt really feel like the project was challenging, i know theres gonna be some space issues in the menu if you want to add more priceclasses but i assume that would happen for any or most companies.
I also dont like the way its written to append new elements to the DOM. But ill try my fix for that in the next project.
